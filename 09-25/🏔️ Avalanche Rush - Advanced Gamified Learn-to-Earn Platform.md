**A decentralized blockchain game leveraging Reactive Smart Contracts for automated quest completion and reward distribution with comprehensive gameplay mechanics.**

## üìã Executive Summary

Avalanche Rush represents a revolutionary approach to Web3 education through gaming. By utilizing **Reactive Smart Contracts (RSCs)**, the platform creates an automated, trustless educational gaming environment that solves critical problems in Web3 onboarding through event-driven automation that would be impossible with traditional smart contracts.

## üéØ Problem Statement & Reactive Solution

### The Critical Problem: Manual Quest Verification Bottleneck

Traditional learn-to-earn platforms face fundamental limitations where smart contracts cannot autonomously respond to on-chain events. This creates centralized verification requirements, delayed reward distribution, high gas costs for users, and poor user experience from manual claim processes.

### Why Reactive Smart Contracts Are Essential

**Without RSCs**, platforms require centralized cron jobs polling blockchain events, users paying gas fees to claim every reward, delayed educational feedback breaking learning flow, and complex manual verification systems.

**With RSCs**, we achieve automatic reward distribution upon quest completion, zero user gas costs for claiming rewards, instant educational feedback enhancing learning, and fully decentralized and trustless verification.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** 16+ and **npm**
- **MetaMask** wallet configured for Avalanche and Reactive networks
- **Private key** with testnet funds (AVAX and REACT tokens)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/lucylow/avalanche-rush.git
cd avalanche-rush-game

# Install dependencies
npm run setup

# Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your configuration:
# PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key
# SNOWTRACE_API_KEY=your_api_key
# REACTIVE_RPC_URL=https://rpc.reactive.network
```

### Smart Contract Deployment

```bash
# Compile contracts
npm run compile

# Deploy to Avalanche Fuji Testnet
npm run deploy:avalanche

# Deploy to Reactive Mainnet
npm run deploy:reactive

# Run tests
npm run test:contracts
```

### Frontend Development

```bash
# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build
```

## üìä Reactive Usage Metrics

### Transaction Flow & REACT Gas Consumption

| Step | Transaction Type | REACT Gas Used | Purpose |
|------|------------------|----------------|---------|
| 1 | User completes on-chain action | 0 | User pays gas on Avalanche C-Chain |
| 2 | **Reactive Event Detection** | 2,000 REACT | RSC detects Transfer/Swap event |
| 3 | **Reactive Verification** | 5,000 REACT | Quest completion logic execution |
| 4 | **Reactive NFT Minting** | 15,000 REACT | Automated NFT reward distribution |
| 5 | **Reactive Token Rewards** | 8,000 REACT | Automatic token distribution |
| 6 | **Reactive Raffle Entry** | 3,000 REACT | Chainlink VRF ticket allocation |

**Total per quest completion: ~33,000 REACT gas**

### Projected Monthly Usage

- **100 active users** √ó **10 quests/month** = 1,000 quest completions
- **1,000 completions** √ó **33,000 REACT** = 33,000,000 REACT monthly consumption
- **Chainlink VRF raffles**: 4 weekly raffles √ó 50,000 REACT = 200,000 REACT monthly

## üîí Security Features

### Comprehensive Security Measures

The platform implements multiple layers of security including reentrancy protection, access controls, input validation, and comprehensive error handling. All contracts undergo thorough testing with 100% coverage for critical functions.

### Code Quality Standards

- **NatSpec documentation** for all public methods
- **Modular architecture** for easy maintenance
- **Gas optimization** using assembly where appropriate
- **Comprehensive error handling** with descriptive messages

## üìã Step-by-Step Workflow

### Phase 1: User Registration & Quest Start
1. User connects wallet to Avalanche Rush dApp
2. System detects new player ‚Üí Reactive contract initializes user profile
3. User selects educational quest and views tutorial content

### Phase 2: Educational Content & Verification
1. User completes educational content and quiz
2. User performs required on-chain action (e.g., token transfer, DEX swap)
3. Transaction is broadcast to Avalanche C-Chain

### Phase 3: Reactive Automation Trigger
1. Reactive Smart Contract detects the blockchain event
2. Automated verification checks if transaction meets quest criteria
3. Reactive transaction executes reward distribution

### Phase 4: Automated Reward Distribution
1. Educational NFT minted to user's wallet via Reactive transaction
2. RUSH tokens distributed to user's address
3. Raffle tickets allocated for weekly Chainlink VRF drawing

### Phase 5: Weekly Raffle via Chainlink VRF
1. Friday 12:00 UTC: Reactive contract requests randomness from Chainlink
2. VRF callback: Random winner selected from ticket holders
3. Rare NFT automatically minted to winner via Reactive transaction
