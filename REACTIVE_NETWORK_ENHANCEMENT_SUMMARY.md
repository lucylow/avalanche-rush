## 🎮 Enhanced User Experience

### Frontend Integration
**File: `src/pages/ReactiveQuestPage.tsx` (Enhanced)**
- Added bounty system integration
- Enhanced contract interaction
- Improved user feedback and status display
- Better error handling and loading states

### Key Improvements:
- ✅ Real-time quest status updates

- ✅ Enhanced achievement display
- ✅ Better user onboarding flow

## 🔗 Reactive Network Integration Details

### Event Subscription
Based on [reactive-smart-contract-demos](https://github.com/Reactive-Network/reactive-smart-contract-demos), the system now properly:

1. **Subscribes to Avalanche C-Chain Events**
   - Native AVAX Transfer events (address(0))
   - ERC20 Transfer events (specific contract addresses)
   - Proper event signature handling

2. **Processes Cross-Chain Events**
   - Validates event source (chainId = 43114 for Avalanche C-Chain)
   - Decodes Transfer event data (from, to, value)
   - Applies quest completion logic

3. **Automated Response System**
   - Instantly processes qualifying transfers
   - Mints achievement NFTs
   - Distributes bounty rewards
   - Updates quest completion status

## 📊 Enhanced Features

### Quest Management
- **Multiple Quest Types**: Support for different transfer requirements
- **Flexible Configuration**: Target contracts, minimum amounts, rewards
- **Active/Inactive States**: Dynamic quest management
- **Completion Tracking**: Individual player progress

### Bounty System
- **Automated Distribution**: Instant reward distribution on quest completion
- **Reward Accumulation**: Players can accumulate rewards over time
- **Distribution Limits**: Configurable maximum distributions per bounty
- **Analytics**: Comprehensive system and player statistics

### Security & Controls
- **Access Control**: Proper owner and quest engine permissions
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive parameter validation
- **Emergency Functions**: Pause/resume capabilities
- **Reentrancy Protection**: Secure contract interactions

## 🚀 Deployment & Configuration

### Network Configuration
Updated `hardhat.config.js` with proper Reactive Network endpoints:
- **Reactive Mainnet**: `https://mainnet.reactive.network` (Chain ID: 5318008)
- **Reactive Testnet**: `https://testnet.reactive.network` (Chain ID: 1685867489)

### Deployment Process
```bash
# Deploy to Avalanche Fuji Testnet
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy-reactive-quest.js --network fuji

# Deploy to Avalanche Mainnet
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy-reactive-quest.js --network avalanche
